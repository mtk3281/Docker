        <h1>How Jenkins Works</h1>
        <p>
            Jenkins is an open-source automation server used to automate various stages of software development, including building, testing, and deploying code. It is widely used for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.
        </p>

        <h2>Basic Concepts</h2>
        <div class="basic-concepts">
            <div class="concept">
                <h3>Pipeline</h3>
                <p>A sequence of automated processes that code goes through, including building, testing, and deploying. Jenkins pipelines define these stages in a script or configuration file.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="concept">
                <h3>Job</h3>
                <p>A single task or step in the pipeline, such as compiling code or running tests. Jobs can be configured and scheduled to run automatically.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="concept">
                <h3>Build</h3>
                <p>The process of compiling code and creating executable files or packages. Jenkins can manage and trigger builds automatically based on code changes.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="concept">
                <h3>Slave/Agent</h3>
                <p>A machine that runs jobs for Jenkins. Jenkins uses master-slave architecture to distribute the workload across multiple machines.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="concept">
                <h3>Plugin</h3>
                <p>Jenkins plugins extend its functionality, allowing integration with other tools, additional features, and customizations.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>How Jenkins Works</h2>
        <p>
            Jenkins follows a master-slave architecture where:
        </p>
        <div class="architecture">
            <div class="architecture-item">
                <h3>Master</h3>
                <p>The central server that manages the Jenkins environment, schedules jobs, and monitors the execution of tasks. It also handles the management of build configurations and user interfaces.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="architecture-item">
                <h3>Slaves</h3>
                <p>Additional servers that execute jobs and build processes. Slaves can be configured to handle specific tasks and scale Jenkins capabilities.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Step-by-Step Process:</h3>
        <div class="process-steps">
            <div class="step">
                <h3>1. Source Code Management</h3>
                <p>Jenkins monitors a source code repository (like Git) for changes. When a change is detected, Jenkins triggers the pipeline or job.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="step">
                <h3>2. Build</h3>
                <p>Jenkins executes the build process, compiling the code and creating artifacts.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="step">
                <h3>3. Test</h3>
                <p>Jenkins runs automated tests to ensure the code changes do not introduce errors or break existing functionality.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="step">
                <h3>4. Deploy</h3>
                <p>If the build and tests are successful, Jenkins deploys the code to a staging or production environment.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="step">
                <h3>5. Notify</h3>
                <p>Jenkins can send notifications about the build status or any issues encountered during the process.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>
            Jenkins provides a flexible and scalable approach to automating software development processes, making it easier to deliver high-quality software rapidly.
